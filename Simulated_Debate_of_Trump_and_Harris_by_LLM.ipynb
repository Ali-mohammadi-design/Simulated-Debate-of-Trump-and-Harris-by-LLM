      "Let me tell you something about migration, Kamala. We need to secure our borders and protect our country from illegal immigration. I've been working hard to build the wall and strengthen our immigration policies to keep America safe. We can't have open borders like your radical left-wing buddies want. It's about putting America first and keeping our citizens safe.\n",

      "Oh, Donald, I understand the importance of border security and protecting our nation. However, the issue of immigration goes beyond just building a wall. We need comprehensive immigration reform that not only secures our borders but also provides a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who are contributing to our society. Demonizing immigrants and separating families at the border is not the answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are a nation of immigrants, and we should embrace our diversity and recognize the valuable contributions that immigrants make to our economy and culture. We need a humane and compassionate approach to immigration that upholds our values as a nation of immigrants.\n",

      "Donald Trump (to kamala_harris):\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala, here you go again with the same old talking points. Let me set the record straight. I have always said that I want immigrants to come to our country legally and contribute positively to our society. But we can't just let anyone come in unchecked. We need strong borders to prevent illegal immigration and protect American jobs. The safety and security of Americans come first.\n",
      "\n",
      "And let's not forget about MS-13 and other dangerous criminal gangs that exploit our weak immigration system. I have been tough on illegal immigration and have taken steps to crack down on these criminal organizations. We need to prioritize the safety of American citizens over everything else. That's why we need to continue building the wall and enforcing our immigration laws to keep America safe and secure.\n",

      "Donald, I agree that we must prioritize the safety and security of American citizens, but demonizing all immigrants as potential criminals undermines the contributions and values they bring to our country. As a former prosecutor, I understand the importance of enforcing our laws and keeping our communities safe from criminal organizations like MS-13. However, we need to do so in a way that is fair and just.\n",
      "\n",
      "We must address the root causes of illegal immigration, such as lack of economic opportunities and violence in immigrants' home countries. We also need to reform our immigration system to make it more efficient and humane. Building a wall is not a comprehensive solution to the complex issue of immigration. We need to work towards comprehensive immigration reform that balances border security with compassion and respect for human rights.\n",

      "Kamala, I appreciate your perspective, but let's be realistic here. We can't just sit back and ignore the fact that illegal immigration poses a significant threat to our country. We need to enforce our laws and protect our borders to ensure the safety of all Americans. It's not about demonizing immigrants; it's about upholding the rule of law and safeguarding our nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have been advocating for a merit-based immigration system that welcomes immigrants who can contribute to our economy and society. We need to prioritize legal immigration and ensure that those who come to our country do so through the proper channels. By cracking down on illegal immigration and reforming our immigration system, we can create a fair and just process that benefits both immigrants and American citizens. Let's put America first and work together to address these issues in a way that benefits everyone.\n",

      "A merit-based immigration system can certainly be part of the conversation, but it must also take into account the needs of our economy and the contributions that immigrants make to our society. We must also prioritize keeping families together and providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who are already contributing to our communities. Let's work together to find common-sense solutions that uphold our values as a nation of immigrants while ensuring the safety and security of all Americans.\n",
