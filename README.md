# Simulated Debate of Trump and Harris by LLM
Do you want to find out what Trump and Harris think about different topics? 


This code has utilized Conversable Agents to create a simulated debate between Trump and Harris. You can choose a topic, and then they will debate, allowing you to see their opinions on that specific topic. After the debate, you can also view the key points of each of their arguments.




## How to use
At the end of the code, there is a function called debate(). This function takes two inputs: "topic" and "number".

 The topic represents the subject of the debate between Trump and Harris, and the number represents the count of their responses to each other. The larger the number, the longer the debate.
 
Therefore, please insert your API key in the “Your open AI API” field and specify the topic and the number of responses. Then observe the argument and its summary.
